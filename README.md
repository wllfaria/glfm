<h1>Glyph File Manager</h1>

Lightweight File Manager written in Rust that comes with a TUI.

## Motivation
Glm was originally created to be the file manager for the [Glyph Text Editor](https://github.com/wllfaria/glyph) but I decided to also
ship it with a intuitive TUI to be used as a standalone application. Glm was
built to be frontend independent, which means it can be used as a library and
other frontends could be built on top of it.
